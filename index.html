        <h3>Funny story</h3>
        <p>When we went to visit the temples of Teotihuacan, we booked a tour that offered many things. One of which was a tasting table of mezcal (Which is an agave strong alcoholic drink
           similar to tequilla but way smokier).Needless to say it was a very fun experience. After the tasting, by pure coincidence I imagine, we visited the gift shop (pretty tipsy I might add) where we were told
           that the obsidian figurines that were found there were unique and the only place where you could buy those and get a receipt that allowed you to take it with you on the plane home.
           Not only was this not true but we encountered the exact same figurines just 100m further on the site at about 1/5th of the price without negotiating. I wish I could tell you I was patient and not as naive as I was at
           that moment but then it wouldn't be a funny story. 
           This was the first scam I encountered over there and was not gonna be the last.</p>

        <h3>TL;DR</h3>
        <p>Moral of the story: don't believe the first thing that you're told. Even when the figurines are shiny.</p>
